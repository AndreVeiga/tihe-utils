# Tihe-utils
  Application to assist in app development in JS.

  What: 
   Module developed for my projects using react / react-native, with the purpose of assisting with masking tasks for data input and validation.
  
  Why:
    During my web training, I realized that there are several modules that do this, but I often needed 2, 3 or even 4 modules that made masks, validations and the like.
   
  Goal:
    Helping in the development of my software and learning would even be extremely happy if I could help others.
