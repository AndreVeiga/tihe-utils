# Tihe-utils
  Application to assist in app development in JS.

###  What: 
   Module developed for my projects using react / react-native, with the purpose of assisting with masking tasks for data input and validation.
  
###  Why:
    During my web training, I realized that there are several modules that do this, but I often needed 2, 3 or even 4 modules that made masks, validations and the like.
   
###  Goal:
    Helping in the development of my software and learning would even be extremely happy if I could help others.

  
##  Installation

###  Download and in a browser:
  > <script src="tihe.js"></script>

###  Using npm (global):
  > $ npm i -g tihe-utils
  > $ npm install -g tihe-utils
  
###  Using npm (local):
  > $ npm i tihe-utils
  > $ npm install tihe-utils

####  Note: add a flag --save if you are using npm < 5.0.0

###  Nodejs example:
  // All functions core
  > const tihe = require('tihe-utils)

  or

  // Time functions only
  > const { time } = require('tihe-utils')
